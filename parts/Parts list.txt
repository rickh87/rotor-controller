qty 4 feet (1 on each corner)
qty 1 LVB tracker PCB board. Footprint will be attached as a separate file. The footprint of this
          board should be over the top of the footprint of the Ardnuio so I have the option of 
          installing either the Arduino or the LVB tracker. The Arduino and the LVB tracker will
          never be installed at the same time. It will be either one or the other.
